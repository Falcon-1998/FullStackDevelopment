    <p> Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, 
        being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war 
        and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface 
        gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to 
        the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features 
        reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice 
        aps of Earth.
    </p>
    <p> The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well
         as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the 
         site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar 
    </p>    
   <p> System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth 
    Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact 
    feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These 
    may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.
